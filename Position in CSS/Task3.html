    <p>The sphere or spheroid-shaped Earth is the third planet in the solar system and is the only life-supporting
        planet. When seen from the Earthâ€™s outer surface, it looks blue in colour due to the presence of water and hence
        is called the blue planet. The Earth provides all its inhabitants with the basic amenities which are required
        for survival. The sad fact is that human beings have been exploiting all the resources which have been made
        available to us all this while mindlessly. If this continues, we will put ourselves and all living things in
        great danger. It is high time we took steps to save our planet. Afforestation, using biodegradable products and
        reducing pollution are some measures you could take to preserve the beauty and quality of life on Earth.</p>
